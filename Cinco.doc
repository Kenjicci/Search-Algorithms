Part 1. Exploration and Execution
[] Combine the codes
[] Examine the data structures
[] Run the script
[] record outputs:

Algorithm         |     Start Node | Goal Node | Total Cost (if applicable)
DFS                        a            d           
BFS                        a            d
UCS                        a            d
Greedy Search              Home         Library
A*Search                   Home         Library


Part 2. Analysis and Comparison

Uninformed Search
1. Describe the order of node visitation fo DFS and BFS. Which one is guaranteed to find the shortest path in terms of the number of steps/edges (assuming unweighted edges)?
2. How does Uniform Cost Search (UCS) differ from BFS? Why did UCS choose the path it did, considering the costs: a->b (2), b->c (2), and b->d (5)?
3. Which of the three uninformed algorithm (DFS, BFS, UCS) is generally considered optimal (guaranteed to find the lowest-cost path) when edge weight exists?
